Explanation:

This was an extremely tough assignment. As I've mentioned I have no experience with coding or its adjacent fields whatsoever, and these past two weeks of lessons have forced me to think in very non-intuitive ways. After days of head-scratching, hair-tearing, YouTube-ing, and binge-drinking, I think I managed to make a working model. 

My structure is very track-oriented. I wanted to include as much data as could be reasonably found for each track. This made for a lot of tedium when it came time to demonstrate things like Track_Songwriters, which required me to list each track of this album twice. I also wanted to make for a better search feature, which is why I included Moods and Tags to help users discover tracks (and although I didn't include nearly as many tags and moods as would really be necessary, I felt I made my point with 5 and 6 respectively). I felt that if enough information is provided per track, it's then also information that can be suggested about the album, or the artist as a whole through derivation. Working up from the most granular base seemed logical to me.

There's probably tons of errors with what's here. This is all new to me. I showed my schema to my girlfriend, who has no understanding of coding either, and she was able to understand fundamentally what I was trying to display. That makes me feel as though I've structured things somewhat well. However, I do recognize that this schema really only seems to work for traditional musicians, much like early CDDB. I considered adding more open-ended fields for Orator, Performer, and Author, as well as more specific ones like Guitarist, Pianist, Drummer, Composer, etcetera, but I felt as though I was quickly swimming out of my depth. I want first to have a firm grasp of the fundamental concepts I've attempted to explore in the schema and this .txt file before moving on to more complicated ideas.

I look forward to your feedback. (Though not so much to actually fixing whatever's wrong.)
