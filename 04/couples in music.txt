I would like to create a digital exhibit that showcases music made by married/long-term partners together, whether they are in a group together or not. 
Some of the questions I considered were:

How do I handle a band with members who are married? 
How about the other members? 
How about individual artists who are married (but not in a band) and make a song or album together? How do I define the relationship?
How do I represent the current status of that relationship (married, divorced, split)? And is it important to chart marriage date? 

Wanting to chart the longevity of a group, I run into an issue of: a single field for “Years active” but then that introduces complexity in how the data is entered…or split that into two fields, “first year” and “last year” or something like that, but then, what if there’s a period where the group splits up and then gets back together? 
MusicBrainz uses the following criteria for that field: “Begin date represents the date when the group first formed: 
if a group dissolved and then reunited, the date is still that of when they first formed. 
End date represents the date when the group last dissolved: if a group dissolved and then reunited, the date is that of when they last dissolved (if they are together, it should be blank!).”

The same issue arises when trying to chart the longevity of the couple’s relationship. 
Relationship_begin: year the couple began to be together. 
This can be the start of a relationship, the year of marriage, whatever is generally recognized and known to be the start of the partnership.
Relationship_end: year the couple is no longer together (if applicable). 
Relationship_type: married or domestic partners
