The audio set I have in mind is a historical documentary of voices from my hometown, Mobile, Alabama. Titled, "Voices of Mobile, a 100-Year Audio Walk," the items featured will depict people, events and places significant to the city. Genres represented include field recordings, interviews, stories, readings and news stories. Pulling from CDDB and Free DB formats, the elements I would like to show off in this set include:  Primary Key Information including Author/Producer, Title, Source URL, year of recording, and Extra Information, then show relationships with Track Titles, Contributors including name, Birth/Death Years, and Extra related information, genre of the recording, and finally permissions since some of the items are copyrighted, and some are in the public domain.
